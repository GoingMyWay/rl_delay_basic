This repository contains the implementation of the delayed-RL agent from the paper:
"Acting in Delayed Environments with Non-Stationary Markov Policies", Esther Derman<sup>\*</sup>, Gal Dalal<sup>\*</sup>, Shie Mannor (<sup>*</sup>equal contribution). 

The agent here supports the Cartpole and Acrobot environments by OpenAI. The Atari-supported agent will be released in a separate repository.
